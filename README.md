A processing game that really sucks.

How to play:
You are a character who is stuck in space. You need to escape the different levels by first navigating to a star to obtain a key to open the black hole, and then jump into that black hole. There are various items that are to assist you on yor journey.
Bomb: explode the blue obstacle away from your path, by pressing [q]
Teleport: teleport to a random place in the game. Who knows, you have a 0.25% chance of teleporting to the exit! [e]
Pause: This pauses time in the game, allowing you to pass through all obstacles. Beware that pausing time will make all of the items dissapear!
Exit: This is the exit. Reach it to survive
Star: This is a checkpoint. You must visit it before proceeding to the exit
T: This is a toll wall. You must pay one money in order for it to go away.
Money: You can use this to open toll walls.
Space: This is the void of space. You navigate this

You lose if you end up getting stuck and cannot reach the exit. Save up on those bombs and monies!
There is no winning, you just need to survive for as long as possible.
